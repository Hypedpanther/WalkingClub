# WalkingClub
Problem description 
 
Once a year a walking club asks all its members to submit the total number of miles they have walked. The club collates this information in a text file. A section of the .txt file, which includes the names of members and the total miles they walked, is shown below. 
 
… 
Nikolai,Bryant,145.6 
Susan,Brown,34.2 
Teressa,Jones,398.5 
… 
 
The information in the file is then used to select prize winners. Prizes will be awarded for: 
 
•	the furthest distance walked 
•	any members who have walked more than 70% of the furthest distance 
 
A program is required to read the data for each member from the text file. The program should use this data to find then display the furthest distance walked. The names of every member who has walked more than 70% of the furthest distance should be written to an empty text file so that the file can be printed out later.
